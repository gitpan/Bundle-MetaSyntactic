=head1 NAME

Bundle::MetaSyntactic - All Acme::MetaSyntactic themes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::MetaSyntactic'>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Acme::MetaSyntactic> is a module designed to fill all your metasyntactic
needs. There was a weekly update with new themes on CPAN between January
15, 2005 and November 6, 2006.

Since version 0.99, the weekly uploads of the module have stopped,
while I take some rest. I'm also looking for a better way to distribute
the core modules and the themes themselves. The current idea is to have
theme packs.

However, some users of C<Acme::MetaSyntactic> desperately needed new
themes to be added, and grew tired of waiting for me. So, in a JFDI way,
they started to upload their own themes on CPAN.

This bundle brings you all the official and not-yet-official
C<Acme::MetaSyntactic> themes, in a single command (see the L<SYNOPSIS>).
