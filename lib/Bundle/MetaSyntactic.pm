=head1 NAME

Bundle::MetaSyntactic - All Acme::MetaSyntactic themes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::MetaSyntactic'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> is a module designed to fill all your metasyntactic
needs. There was a weekly update with new themes on CPAN between January
15, 2005 and November 6, 2006.

Since version 0.99, the weekly uploads of the module have stopped,
while I took some rest. I've also been looking for a better way to distribute
the core modules and the themes themselves.

However, some users of L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> desperately needed new
themes to be added, and grew tired of waiting for me. So, in a JFDI way,
they started to upload their own themes on CPAN.

On May 7, 2012, after a hiatus of five and a half years,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> is back, in a shiny version 1.000.
The main C<Acme-MetaSyntactic> distribution contains the core modules
and a single theme, while all "historical" themes now live in the
C<Acme-MetaSyntactic-Themes> distribution.

The L<Test::MetaSyntactic> module included in the main distribution
aims at simplifying the test and distribution of new themes by
individual authors.

This bundle brings you all the official and not-so-official
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> themes, in a single command (see the L<SYNOPSIS>).
